## üìñ What is Agile?

**Agile** is a modern software development methodology focused on:
- Iterative development
- Continuous feedback
- Flexibility to change
- Collaboration among cross-functional teams

### üîÅ Agile Values (From Agile Manifesto):
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4. Responding to change over following a plan

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Scrum?

**Scrum** is a popular **Agile framework** for managing work and teams.

### Key Concepts:
- **Sprint**: Time-boxed iteration (usually 1‚Äì2 weeks)
- **Product Backlog**: A list of all features and work to be done
- **Sprint Backlog**: Subset of backlog items selected for a sprint
- **Daily Scrum**: 15-minute standup meeting
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect and improve process

---

## üë• Scrum Roles & Responsibilities

### **Product Owner**
- Defines product vision and requirements
- Manages and prioritizes the Product Backlog
- Writes user stories and acceptance criteria
- Makes final decisions on features

### **Scrum Master**
- Facilitates Scrum ceremonies
- Removes blockers for the team
- Coaches the team on Agile practices
- Shields team from external interruptions

### **Development Team**
- Self-organizing cross-functional team
- Estimates story points
- Develops and tests the product
- Commits to sprint goals

---

## üíº What is JIRA?

**JIRA** is a project management and issue-tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It‚Äôs widely used for Agile software development with built-in Scrum and Kanban boards.

**Use JIRA to:**
- Create and manage tasks (issues)
- Track progress via boards
- Organize work in sprints
- Assign and prioritize issues
- Link code (via GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.)

## üöÄ Getting Started with JIRA

### **Step 1: Create Your Account**
1. Go to [https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
2. Click **"Get started for free"**
3. Enter your email and create password
4. Choose your site name (e.g., `yourname.atlassian.net`)

### **Step 2: Understanding JIRA Interface**
- **Dashboard**: Main overview page
- **Projects**: Container for all your issues
- **Backlog**: List of all work items
- **Board**: Visual workflow (Kanban/Scrum)
- **Issues**: Individual work items
- **Reports**: Sprint and team performance metrics

## üìö Key Agile Terminology

| Term             | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| **Epic**         | A large goal broken into stories (e.g. "Deploy app") |
| **Story**        | A user-facing feature or functionality (e.g. "As a user, I can login") |
| **Task**         | A technical or non-user-facing action (e.g. "Create Mongoose schema") |
| **Sub-task**     | A smaller part of a task or story |
| **Bug**          | A problem/defect to fix |
| **Sprint**       | A fixed time period to complete selected backlog items |
| **Backlog**      | The complete list of work needed in the project |
| **Story Points** | A measure of **relative effort/complexity** of a task (not exact hours) |
| **Velocity**     | Total story points completed in a sprint |

---

## üßÆ Understanding Story Points

Story Points estimate the **effort**, **risk**, and **complexity** of a task.

### Common Point Scale:
- 1 (Very Easy)
- 2 (Easy)
- 3 (Moderate)
- 5 (Complex)
- 8 (Very Complex)
- 13+ (Break it down!)

> Example:  
> - "Create login API" ‚Äì 3 points  
> - "Build Chat UI with streaming" ‚Äì 8 points

### **Estimation Techniques:**
- **Planning Poker**: Team votes on story points using cards
- **T-Shirt Sizing**: XS, S, M, L, XL (then convert to numbers)
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 (reflects uncertainty)

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Good User Stories

### **User Story Format:**
```
As a [user type], I want [functionality], so that [benefit/value]
```

### **Examples:**
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "As a registered user, I want to reset my password via email, so that I can regain access to my account"
- ‚ùå **Bad**: "Password reset feature"

### **Acceptance Criteria:**
Define what "done" means for each story:
```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

**Example:**
- Given I'm on the login page
- When I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email
- Then I should receive a password reset email within 5 minutes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Making Stories Too Big**: Break down stories that take more than 1-2 days
2. **No Acceptance Criteria**: Always define what "done" means
3. **Ignoring Story Points**: Don't just use hours, use relative complexity
4. **Overcommitting in Sprints**: Start small and build team velocity
5. **Not Using Sub-tasks**: Break complex stories into manageable pieces
6. **Skipping Daily Standups**: Communication is key in Agile
7. **Not Updating Issue Status**: Keep the board current

---

## üí° Best Practices

### **For Product Owners:**
- Keep backlog refined and prioritized
- Write clear user stories with acceptance criteria
- Be available for questions during sprint

### **For Scrum Masters:**
- Keep ceremonies focused and time-boxed
- Remove blockers quickly
- Track team velocity and improve estimates

### **For Developers:**
- Update issues daily
- Ask questions early if requirements are unclear
- Collaborate on estimation

### **JIRA Tips:**
- Use labels for easy filtering (e.g., "frontend", "backend", "urgent")
- Set up automation rules for repetitive tasks
- Use JQL (JIRA Query Language) for advanced searches
- Create custom dashboards for different stakeholders
